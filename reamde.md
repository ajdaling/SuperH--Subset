Repo containing institution subset of FSP for use by Fullstackers. 

The data folder contains the raw JSON returned from the server. The names of the JSON files correspond to the ajax GET requests found in the client side code. The primary .js file for instData.html is instData.js, and the .js file supporting the network visualization is found in myInstNetwork.js

Sample images are provided in the 'images' folder.
